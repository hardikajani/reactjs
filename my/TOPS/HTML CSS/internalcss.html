		<h2>a motherboard</h2>
		<div>The motherboard of a computer is the circuit board on which all the basic and high-end chipsets are installed. All the circuits installed on the motherboard propel the working of a computer. The motherboard is one of the main parts of a computer and is also known as the printed circuit board. It is present in all computer systems, be it general-purpose systems or expandable ones. The main electronic components of a computer such as its central processor, interface connectors, memory controllers are all integrated into the motherboard. The peripheral components, sound cards, hard drives, interface cards, network cards, video cards, and cards for extra USB slots, are attached to the motherboard.</div>

		<h2>a central processing unit</h2>
		<div>CPU or the Central Processing Unit is among the basic parts of the computer and is often referred to as the brain of the computer. All the data provided to a computer is processed in the Central Processing Unit of the computer. The instructions given to a computer through various computer programs are executed in this processor. The basic controlling, logical, arithmetic and I/O operations are executed in the CPU. There are two components of a basic CPU, namely, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and the Control Unit. All the arithmetic and logical operations are carried out in the ALU. The results of the arithmetic operations are stored in the processor. The Control Unit fetches the instructions from the memory and facilitates their execution.</div>
		<h2>a graphics processing unit</h2>
		<div>The Graphics Processing Unit is used as a co-processor to enhance the performance of the Central Processing Unit in engineering and scientific computing. It offloads some of the time-consuming parts of program codes, to improve the performance of the CPU.  The Graphics Processing Unit boosts the CPU performance by providing a parallel processing facility. A GPU may contain hundreds of cores, whereas a CPU contains a maximum of 8 cores. The highly programmable feature of graphics chips led to the invention of the Graphics Processing Unit.</div>
		<h2>a random access memory</h2>
		<div>Random Access Memory or RAM refers to the volatile memory of a computer. It is a very common topic covered in the chapter on the parts of computers for kids. It is referred to as the main memory of the computer. RAM is one of the main parts of a computer and it stores the application programs, operating system, and the data that is currently used. It takes a shorter time to read data from RAM and to write data in it. Therefore, the processor of a computer can access the data stored in the Random Access Memory, in a short time. As stated above, RAM is volatile, that is, all the data stored in it is lost when we turn off the computer. So, every time we restart the computer the operating system along with the other programs is reloaded into RAM from the hard disk drive. Also, RAM can hold less data than a hard disk, so it can be stored in microchips. For example, RAM can hold 8 GB of data whereas a hard disk can hold 10 TB of data.</div>
		<h2>a hard disk or solid-state drive</h2>
		<div>One of the basic parts of a computer is constituted by its storage components. The solid-state drive and the hard disk drive are the key storage components of a computer. The hard disk drive of a computer system stores data permanently. Therefore, even if you turn off the computer, the data stored in the hard disk drive will be saved. All the important data, software programs, and operating systems are stored in the hard disk drive of a computer. Hard disk drives are secondary storage devices.</div>
		<h2>a keybord</h2>
		<div>Kids will get an idea of the main parts of the computer as discussed above. However, for a better understanding of the working of these components, it is important to get hands-on learning experience on the parts of the computer for kids.</div>
