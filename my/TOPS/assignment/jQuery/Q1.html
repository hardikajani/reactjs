        <h1> Q1 - What is jQuery?</h1>
        <p>Ans : jQuery is a small, light-weight and fast JavaScript library. It is cross-platform and supports different types of browsers. It is also referred as ?write less do more? because it takes a lot of common tasks that requires many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and binds them into methods that can be called with a single line of code whenever needed. It is also very useful to simplify a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>
